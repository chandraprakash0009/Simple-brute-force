## 3468. Find the Number of Copy Arrays

You are given an array original of length n and a 2D array bounds of length n x 2, where bounds[i] = [ui, vi].

You need to find the number of possible arrays copy of length n such that:

(copy[i] - copy[i - 1]) == (original[i] - original[i - 1]) for 1 <= i <= n - 1.  
ui <= copy[i] <= vi for 0 <= i <= n - 1.  
Return the number of such arrays.  

 

Example 1:

Input: original = [1,2,3,4], bounds = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]

Output: 2

Explanation:

The possible arrays are:

[1, 2, 3, 4]
[2, 3, 4, 5]
Example 2:

Input: original = [1,2,3,4], bounds = [[1,10],[2,9],[3,8],[4,7]]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The possible arrays are:

[1, 2, 3, 4]
[2, 3, 4, 5]
[3, 4, 5, 6]
[4, 5, 6, 7]
Example 3:

Input: original = [1,2,1,2], bounds = [[1,1],[2,3],[3,3],[2,3]]

Output: 0

Explanation:

No array is possible.

 

Constraints:

2 <= n == original.length <= 105
1 <= original[i] <= 109
bounds.length == n
bounds[i].length == 2
1 <= bounds[i][0] <= bounds[i][1] <= 109

### Approach
We have to form number of array whose difference of adjacent element should be equal to the corresponding diiference in original array.  
The ith element should be from ith bounds.
Since we can start forming array from any element but that should be in the range of first bound, after that first element will decide next element using the difference in the original array.  
Starting from one by one will leads to time limit exceed.   
What if we track the range??   
After the last bound, we can find the number of element in that range which will be our answer.
At each ith index, the element will be decided by the previous element plus the difference at the corresponding original array.   
If at any index our current range does not overlap then it means that no array could be formed and hence return 0.  
Otherwise update the range. 

#### JAVA CODE
```
class Solution {
    public int countArrays(int[] original, int[][] bounds) {
        int low=bounds[0][0], high=bounds[0][1];
        for(int i=1; i<bounds.length; i++){
            int diff=original[i]-original[i-1];
            int nlow=low+diff;
            int nhigh=high+diff;
            if(nlow>bounds[i][1] || nhigh<bounds[i][0]){
                return 0;
            }
            low = Math.max(nlow,bounds[i][0]);
            high = Math.min(nhigh,bounds[i][1]);
        }
        return high-low+1;
    }
}
